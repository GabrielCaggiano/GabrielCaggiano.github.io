              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>Near the source of the Jordan River, early settlers of the area found some natural hotsprings, and decided to to create a resort named "Beck's Saratoga Springs", the name being inspired by the original resort in New York.  This occurred around 1884, and the area grew around trhe resort.  In the late 1990's, landowners came together and incorporated the town of Saratoga Springs, which later became a city in May of 2001.  The area continues to urbanize and is among the fastest growing cities in the nation.</p>
