            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience for the Harvest Hills Neighbors site would be parents or other adult members of the apartment/condo community.  They would have to be at least 18 years old but could be anywhere from 18-60 years old.  Most people would be accessing the site via a mobile device but there would still be users occasionally using the desktop version.<br><br>
            Someone might access this site looking to see what the weather will be like on the weekend or double check their kids sports schedule, or maybe just to see if there are any items for sale or any events this weekend.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>Personas - The Parent and the Planner</h2>
            <p> The Parent.<br><br> 
                This is any parent who is looking for community activities to enroll their child in.  They would be accessing the site to either look for different community programs that might be availble, or to double check if the weather will permit the game this weekend or to check their childs practice schedule.  They would most likely be between the ages of 28-50 and would primarily access the site from a mobile device.<br><br>  
                The Planner.  <br><br> 
                This is any adult who is planning to do just about anything.  They might be trying to sell something, or plan an activity for the weekend, or maybe planning to move in or out.  They would be accessing the site to not just check the weather to confirm if their plans will work out, but to also get information on the community, ask questions, and find resources.  Again they would primarily access the site from a mobile devive and sometimes access it from a desktop.

              <h2>Scenarios</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Is the little league game still on for this Saturday?  It looks like it might be raining with a chance of lightning.</li>
                  <li>Can someone help me figure out how to get a maintenance request submitted?  My oven has been broken for 3 days now.</li>
                  <li>I can't remember when signs ups were for the dance classes.  Can you check the site to see when that is?</li>
                  <li>Why don't we have a cook out this weekend at the park?  What does the weather look like?</li>
                  <li>Does anyone have any boxes they could live without?  Getting ready to move out and looking for moving boxes on the cheap.</li>
