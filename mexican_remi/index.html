          <h2>The Game</h2>

          <p>Mexican Rummy is a card game with the objective to get rid of all of the cards in your hand each round, and be the player with the lowest score at the end of all rounds.  There are 6 rounds, each round with a different objective.
          </p>

          <p>Each round has a different objective that all players are tyring to achieve, every player moves to the next round regardless of whether they achieved the objective or not.  The round ends when one player has no more cards left in their hand.  You achieve this by first meting the round objective, and then playing cards onto your own objective, or onto other players objectives.</p>

          <h3>What you need to play</h3>

          <p>You will only need two decks of normal playing cards, prefferably different colors, and you won't need the jokers.  And make sure to grab a pen and paper to track the scores.  You can play this with as little as 2, but 3-6 would be the preferred number of players.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>

          <p>First take the two decks and shuffle them together, then deal each player 10 cards each.  The rest of the cards go to the center of the table and become the draw pile.  You are now ready to play.  Play commences from the person left of the dealer, and the dealer moves left one person at the start of the next round.</p>

          <h2>Play</h2>

          <h3>Draw and Discard</h3>

          <p>On your turn, draw a card either from the draw pile or take the top card of the discard pile and put it in your hand (See special rules for "May I").  If you have met the round objective, you may "lay down" the cards that meet the objective.  If anyone else has laid down the objective, you may play any cards that fit into your own or any other players objective.  If you have any cards left in your hand, you now discard one.</p>
          <p>If you have not met the objective, then you choose a card to discard, and play continues to the left.</p>

          <h3>Round Objectives</h3>

          <p>The round objectives are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>2 sets</li>
              <li>1 set 1 run</li>
              <li>2 runs</li>
              <li>3 sets</li>
              <li>2 sets 1 run</li>
              <li>2 runs 1 set No Discardo (See special rules)</li> 
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>A set is three of a kind, so three 3's or three 4's.  A single set can contain more than 3, but it must be at least 3.</p>
          <p>A run is four cards in a row of the same suit.  A single run can contain more tha 4 cards, but must be at least 4 cards.  Example, 2 ,3 , 4, 5 of diamonds.  They must be contonous and must be the same suit.  The only exception is a black 2 can be used as a wild in runs and can replace any card.  Ace can be used as the low card, ex. ace, 2, 3, 4, or the high card, ex. jack, queen, king,ace.  You cannot use the ace in the middle of a run, ex. king, ace, 2, 3, 4, is not allowed.</p>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>

          <p>Scoring is simple.  Any card from 2-9 is worth 5 points, and 10-K is worth 10 points.  An Ace is worth 15, and if this is a round with runs, then black 2's (wilds) are worth 20 points</p>
          <p>Example: if you have a 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 kings, and an Ace left in your hand when the round ends you wold add them up like this
            <ul>
              <li>3, 4, 5, 7, all worth 5 points each = total 20 points</li>
              <li>The kings are worth 10 each = total 30 points</li>
              <li>the Ace is another 15</li>
              <li>All together you would have 65 points, not a great score.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Special Rules</h2>

          <h3>May I</h3>

            <p>Sometimes someone may discard the exact card you need, but it is not your turn to draw.  If this happens you can say "May I" which is a request to the current player asking them if you can take the top card of the discard pile.  If the player responds affirmativley, you take the top card of the discard pile AND you must take the top card of the deck as a penalty.  Use wisely and strategically, as you may end up with a lot of extra cards.</p>

          <h3>Black 2</h3>

            <p>During a round with runs as part of the objective, you can use a black two (2 of spades or clubs, 4 total availble) as a wild.  It can replace any card in a run, and only in runs.  For example, if you had the 4, 5, and 7 of diamonds, and you had a black tw0, you can play the 2 as a 6 to complete the run.</p>

            <p>Another strategy you can employ with the black 2, is to take a black 2 from another player after they have played it in their objective.  Let's say in the example above, your opponent played the 4,5,black 2, and 7 of diamonds.  You have the 9,10, and queen of spades, you are missing the jack of spades to complete your run.  You also happen to have a 6 of diamonds in your hand,  On your turn after you draw a card, you can give your opponent the 6 of diamonds to trade for their black 2, your opponent must oblige.  However, you cannot do this unless doing so allows you to lay down the round objective, you cannot keep the black 2 in your hand for later, it must be used immediately.  So in the scenario above, if we were in round 2 with the objective of 1 set and 1 run, you would need to have your set of 3, and only need the black 2 to comlete your run in order to be able to take the black 2 from your opponent.</p>

          <h3>No Discardo</h3>

            <p>The last round has an additional requirement that the other rounds do not, you cannot discard a card when you go to lay down the objective.  In order to win this round, you must lay down at least 11 cards all at once and this means every other player will get "stuck" with every card in their hand.</p>

            <p>Lets say you have a set of 4's and you have a run of 2, 3, 4, 5 of hearts, and you also have another run of 9, 10, queen, king of spades, you are missing the jack to complete this run.  In order to win the last round, you must draw either the jack of spades or a black 2 in order to finish the run and then lay down all of your cards.  You cannot have any extra cards that do not fit into the objective, but you can have more than 11 cards, in this example you would be laying down 12 cards since your second run is 5 cards long.</p>
